Feature: Total Funds Required Calculation - Initial Tier 4 (General) Student general with and without dependants (single current account)

    Main applicants Required Maintenance period: Months between course start date and course end date (rounded up & capped to 9 months)
    Main applicant Required Maintenance period is rounded up to the full month (E.g course length of 5month and 5days is rounded up to 6months)

    Dependants Required Maintenance period - Months between main applicants course start date & course end date + wrap up period (rounded up & capped to 9 months)
    Dependants Required Maintenance period is only rounded up to the full month after the wrap up is applied (E.g course length of 5month 2days is wrapped up to 5months and 9days) then rounded up to 6months

    Main applicants leave - Entire course length + wrap up period
    Course length - course start date to course end date (Main Course)
    Wrap up period calculated from original course start date to course end date
    Wrap up period - see table below:

    Main course length 12 month or more = 4 month
    Main course length 6 months or more but less than 12 months = 2 months
    Main course length <6 months = 7 days
    Pre-sessional course length 12 month or more = 4 month
    Pre-sessional course length 6 months or more but less than months = 2 months
    Pre-sessional course length <6 months = 1 months
    If course has ended when considering the case, then wrap up period will be added from case consideration date/processing date ##

    Applicants Required Maintenance threshold general:  In London - £1265, Out London - £1015
    Dependants Required Maintenance threshold: In London - £845, Out London - £680

    Total tuition fees - total amount of the tuition fees for the course
    Tuition fees already paid - total amount of tuition fees already paid
