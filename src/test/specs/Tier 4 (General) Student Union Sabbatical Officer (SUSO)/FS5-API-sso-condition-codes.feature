# Tier 4 (General) Student union sabbatical officer (SUSO)


Feature: Calculation of condition codes for T4 Student Union Sabbatical Officer
## Condition Codes ##

    # DES, PGDD and SUSO have set codes regardless of the course type and course length selected

#    SO THAT I can identify the condition codes for a T4 Student union sabbatical officer applicant
#    AS A Caseworker
#    WOULD LIKE The Financial Status Tool to automatically generate a condition code for a T4 Student union sabbatical officer applicant
