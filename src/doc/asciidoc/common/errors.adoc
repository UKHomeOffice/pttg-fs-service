Errors may occur for several reasons. In the event of any error, the correct HTTP status code will be returned.
See <<HTTP Conventions>>. Where possible, in the event of an error the API will return a response body containing
further details to help diagnose the error, in JSON format.

=== Client Errors

Requests that are invalid due to missing mandatory parameters or incorrectly formatted request bodies etc, will result
in an HTTP 400 status code, and a response body that provides further details. For example, when a mandatory parameter
is missing, a response such as the following example will be provided:

include::{snippets}/missing-parameter-error/http-response.adoc[]

The response body includes the following details:

include::{snippets}/missing-parameter-error/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Detailed Error Codes

Where an error response occurs, one or more of the following error codes may appear and can be used to understand the
cause of the error.
